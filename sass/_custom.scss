WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW BEFORE WORKING

    This is the general process to make visual customizations:

    1. Edit this file, add your own CSS/SCSS code, save the file.

    2. View the page in your browser, while logged in as administrator.
    
    3. Click the "SASS" symbol on the WP admin bar on the page top.
    
    Compiling will start, and a feedback window will be shown.

    The /sass/main.scss file will be compiled to a static CSS.
    
    This CSS is the only one that the theme enqueues.

    As a side note,  the file static CSS name is customizable as well - see functions.php

IMPORTANT INFORMATION  -  IF YOU DON'T WANT TO REINVENT THE WHEEL: 

    Before adding CSS, try to see if there isn't already an utility class for that:
    please take your time to understand and study how Bootstrap works.

    Many times you DON'T NEED to write custom CSS.
    
    Try using Bootstrap classes first.

    It can save you a lot of time,
    eg. to standardize project colors, or fully customize typography.

    First of all, have a ride in the WordPress Customizer.
    Set your project variables,
    So that simple classes like text-primary or bg-primary will refer to your brand color.
    
    Take your time to learn to use Bootstrap 5 classes and utility classes especially.

    To explore things further, please note that picostrap actually implements also BootstrapNinja,
    a small set of SCSS files that supercharges Bootstrap, mostly using it's own Utilities API, or custom SASS
    scripts, to create some more utility classes.
    We built BootstrapNinja with the spirit of offering developers a richer suitcase of reliable tools, supercharging Bootstrap wi
    with some ideas inspired by Tailwind - and our own experience.

    Please take your time to learn using these classes.

IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING PATHS FOR REFERENCING ELEMENTS IN THE THEME FOLDER
    
    Please prepend ../ in the path, as the rendered CSS
    that is executed from the browser is in the /css-output/ theme subfolder
